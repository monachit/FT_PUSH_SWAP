The push_swap project at 42 challenges developers to craft an efficient sorting algorithm using two stacks. With a limited set of moves, including swapping, rotating, and pushing elements, the goal is to sort integers in Stack A. Success demands not just correctness, but optimizationâ€”minimizing moves while achieving the desired sorting outcome. This project sharpens algorithmic prowess, encourages creative problem-solving, and underscores the importance of efficient code.
